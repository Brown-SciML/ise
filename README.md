This repository contains source code for processing climate forcings from [ISMIP6 simulations](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=ad1a6ed8-4de0-4490-93a9-8258931766c7&origin_path=%2FAIS%2F) and creating and testing ice sheet emulators. Neural network based emulators, such as the most recent version, ISEFlow, can be trained and compared to traditional gaussian process emulators along with other functions to help aid in analysis of performance. This repository supports Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet emulation.
