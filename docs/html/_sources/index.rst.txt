ISE Documentation
=================

ISE, or ice-sheet emulators, is a package for end-to-end creation and analysis of ice-sheet emulators.

The main features of ISE include loading and processing of ISMIP6 sea level contribution simulations,
data preparation and feature engineering for machine learning, and training and testing of trained neural network emulators.
The package is divided into two sections: `sectors` and `grids`. The sectors module provides all necessary functions for
creating and training emulators based on the 18 ISMIP6 sectors, while the grids module provides the same functionality
for smaller kilometer-scale grids.
